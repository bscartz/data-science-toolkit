## K-Means Clustering
Class Workbook:
Basic Description: <br/ >

Basic Description: K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning data into clusters based on similarity. is used for clustering data points into groups, making it easier to understand patterns and relationships in the data. <br/ ><br/ >


Usage: <br/ >
This can be used when you want to define a set number of clusters (k). It can be more efficient than Hierarchical on large data sets.<br/ ><br/ >


Possible Baseball Applications:
* Categorize different types of pitches based on various metrics


Possible Business Applications: 
* 

## Hierarchical Clustering

## LASSO Regression
Class Workbook:
Basic Description: 
Usage:
Possible Use Cases:

## Logistic Regression
Class Workbook: <br/ >

Basic Description: <br/ >
Logistic regression models the relationship between one or more independent explanatory variables and a dependent binary classification. <br/ ><br/ >


Usage: <br/ >
This model can be used whenever the response variable is a binary, such as 0/1 or yes/no. It can also be used to predict probability. <br/ ><br/ >


Possible Baseball Applications:
* Predicting whether a team will win a game based on relevant statistics
* Predicting whether a baserunner will steal based on the situation.


Possible Business Applications:
* Predicting whether a customer will continue or cancel his subscription based on usage patterns
* Estimating the risk probability that a person or business will default on a loan.

## Linear Regression

Class Workbook: <br />
[https://rpubs.com/bscartz/linear-regression](https://rpubs.com/bscartz/linear-regression-toolkit) <br />
Included: log transform, interaction terms <br /><br />


Basic Description: <br />
Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent response variable and one or more independent explanatory variables. It fits a linear equation to the data. <br /><br />


Usage: <br />
This model can be used whenever observed variables have a linear relationship with the outcome variable. <br /><br />


Possible Baseball Applications: 
* Predicting statistics based on other statistics when they are reasonably correlated.
  * Predict stolen bases based on top sprint speed.
* Assess the predictive performance of machine learning models.
  * Compare an xwOBA model to actual wOBA production. Does the xwOBA model over / undervalue any particular type of offensive production (power, speed, etc).


Possible Business Applications:
* Predict sales volume based on price
