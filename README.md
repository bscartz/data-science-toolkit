Basic Description: 
Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent response variable and one or more independent explanatory variables. It fits a linear equation to the data.

Possible Use Cases: 
* Predicting statistics based on other statistics when they are reasonably correlated. 
* Assess the predictive performance of machine learning models.
