Basic Description: <br />
Linear regression models the relationship between a dependent response variable and one or more independent explanatory variables. It fits a linear equation to the data. <br /><br />


Usage: <br />
This model can be used whenever observed variables have a linear relationship with the outcome variable. <br /><br />


Possible Baseball Applications: 
* Predicting statistics based on other statistics when they are reasonably correlated.
  * Predict stolen bases based on top sprint speed.
* Assess the predictive performance of machine learning models.
  * Compare an xwOBA model to actual wOBA production. Does the xwOBA model over / undervalue any particular type of offensive production (power, speed, etc).


Possible Business Applications:
* Predict sales volume based on price
